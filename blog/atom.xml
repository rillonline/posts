    <title>My Blog</title>
    <updated>2021-08-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I continue to work with my files, I have been thinking a lot about
this blog. I have entries that are over fifteen years old. Rereading
these is entertaining. I remind myself of things that happened that I
have forgotten. I suppose that is the point of writing: to make a
record that I can refer to at some time in the future. But here’s the
thing: Is anyone going to scroll back that far to read these entries?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I Think I have it!</title>
    <updated>2021-08-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wrote a post lamenting the fact that I could not get
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ablog.readthedocs.io/"&gt;ablog&lt;/a&gt; to work. Well, without any much customization, I think
I have it. Anyway, what I have is working even if it is not elegant.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GPS Uncertainties</title>
    <updated>2021-08-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the air quality, pollen counts and risk of infection, I have not
been going anywhere by myself. Basically, I’m not going anywhere, even
by car. I have to push myself to get out of the house and take a walk.
This is sad for Nick.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Setting up Ablog</title>
    <updated>2021-08-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This has been difficult for me. I went down a number of alleys which
did not lead to joy. In the end, I decided on a very generic
presentation so that &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ablog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; works.&lt;/p&gt;
