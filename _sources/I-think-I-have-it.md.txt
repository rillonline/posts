# I Think I have it!

Yesterday I wrote a post lamenting the fact that I could not get
[ablog][ablog] to work. Well, without any much customization, I think
I have it. Anyway, what I have is working even if it is not elegant. 

Python packages still are a mystery to me even though I can install
them and have even updated them. `:doctree` and other `Sphinx`-related
matters confuse me. But this minimal presentation seems to be working
and it's upkeep should be minimal. Let's hope so.
