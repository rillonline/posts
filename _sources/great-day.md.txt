# Great Day #

Today is a great day for Nick and me.

First of all, we have been together for five years now. Our
anniversary was a few days ago, but I'm writing about it now.

Nick and I had a rocky start, but we have been loyal to one another
through it all.

Today is an especially wonderful day because we finally got out on a
walk together. For the past two weeks or so I have struggled with
unhealthy air quality and high levels of grass pollen. Today air
quality was in the good range and the pollen counts were low for grass,
tree and ragweed. So off we went for our usual daily walk.

I had no difficulty breathing and could keep up with Nick's pace which
was neither slow nor fast. Nick behaved well, at least for Nick on a
walk, and that was great, too.
