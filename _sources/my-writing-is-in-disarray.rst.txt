===========================
 My Writing is in Disarray
===========================


In some ways, the title says it all.

I have started writing again and the question I asked myself is where I
wanted to put what I wrote. I have a love/hate relationship with my
`WordPress`_ blog. It is difficult to post there and I always want to
keep a copy locally.

My best bet is my `github`_, but it would not build under my new
installation of `Nikola`_. It looks like I will have to edit every last
post (because struggling with the ``conf.py`` is more than I can handle
at the moment.) Revisiting old posts is not a bad thing anyway.

I have also started to revisit my Star Runner novels. I thought I would
collect them all in one place along with my blog posts. You see, there
is really method in my madness. Oh dear! I think there is one missing. I
can’t even think of its name. I was not super impressed with it, but it
did tell a story. I can probably recreate it if necessary.

Several backup hard drives have crashed. Perhaps it was there. I have
also discovered I have many copies of the same file and everything needs
to be brought together in one place and cleaned up.

I’m working in Linux on my ChromeBook which I really enjoy. I’m learning
a lot about Emacs, too, and that’s fun.

So as Babylon V says, "So it begins ..."
