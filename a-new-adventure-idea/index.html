<h1>A New Adventure Idea<a class="headerlink" href="#a-new-adventure-idea" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>6 min read<br />
1216 words</p>
<p>I have been reviewing my story arc of
<a class="reference external" href="https://nanowrimo.org/">nanowrimo</a> novelas. Some are better than
others. None of them are <em>The Great American Novel</em>. Being around
50,000 words, none of them are very complicated.</p>
<p>At some point, the story arc sent our heroes into a different part of
the galaxy where the different alien civilizations were at war. It was
difficult for my heroes to navigate these old rivalries. I wasn’t sold
on any of them. Having gone from one group to another I finally came
to a point where I thought my folks should just quit the whole thing
and go home.</p>
<p>Of course, they left home because there were problems. That’s often
why people leave home:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>They need a job.</p></li>
<li><p>They need or want some education.</p></li>
<li><p>They want a change of scene.</p></li>
<li><p>They are running from or to something or someone.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever the reason, it seems like a good idea at the time and often
is.</p>
<p>I had this idea to drift over into fantasy, with a little dose of
magic. I had some of the high level ideas worked out.</p>
<p>*I had a villain.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I had my hero’s character flaw to create a bind for her.</p></li>
<li><p>I had several very high level adventures figured out.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I ran into problems putting the plots into play:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>I really don’t understand fantasy novels.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t usually like reading fantasy novels.</p></li>
<li><p>Do I need sword play?</p></li>
<li><p>Must I have dwarfs and elves?</p></li>
<li><p>Must everything be medieval?</p></li>
<li><p>Do I have to put up with kings and horses and knights with or
without shining armor?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the cost of magic in this group of stories. I’ve learned
enough to know that magic has a cost. My solution was barbaric and
I couldn’t come up with another one.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it enough for my hero to point out the cost of magic is too
high and everyone should just knock it off with the magic already
and modernize.</p></li>
<li><p>But you know, there’s a war on and maybe the tech giants of this
part of the galaxy are too busy reaping the benefits of wartime to
invest in some out-of-the-way planets that most sensible people
avoid and don’t think about if they can.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So it turns out there are four novelas in this group. That’s a lot of
words and a lot of hours. There may be a way to save them, but I’m not
sure about that right now.</p>
<p>What occurs to me is that my heroes need to have been off somewhere
for some time and now they are being recalled. They accept their
mission and I can be back with old haunts and familiar characters. The
old tensions are there. The old rivalries persist and the political
situation has continued to deterriorate. Our characters are still in
danger but the crisis makes it worthwhile for them to return. Loyalty
will be a major theme. Truth-telling will be another.</p>
<p><em>Getting Started with a New Adventure</em></p>
<p>It makes sense to start with where my characters are at.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gyllian Romeres Lujo.
I her married to a professor on Socrates. I think that should be
deleted from any previous novelas. She is a better character as an
independent woman. I have always written about her as an officer in
the Ministry of Defense for the Alliance of Worlds. However, I
uncovered an attitude she had in an earlier Ronnie Camberwell
mystery that I never picked up on afterwards. It’s important to the
larger story arc I am proposing here. Gillian wanted the Solar
League and the Northern Frontier to join forces to break away from
the Coalition because she thought the Clouder was setting itself up
for a power grab. As this story opens, that political attitude has
forced her to resign.</p></li>
<li><p>Josh Hardy and Juliet Maxwell
They got married. They have children (I don’t know how many.) and
they live in Ptolemy City. Josh’s security business is thriving.
Juliet has continued her historical investigations. Being married to
a hacker who has a good relationship with the Fungusian Network, has
allowed Juliet to continue pursuing her historical research into the
Second Expansion. This is not part of the official story of how the
Coalition came to be. It does not put the Clouder in a good light.
But the Confederacy inhabitants have a different version of history
and Juliet has documented it.</p></li>
<li><p>The Czarina and Captain Kidd
The Czarina has continued her work as a gossip blogger. Her delicious
innuendos concerned the rich and famous on Hypatia. Now she cultivates
the same people on the Northern Frontier. Grand Central is their home.
The Czarina is often seen
at the Station Lounge. Of late, she has been
hearing a lot of chatter about realignment, the code word for the
Solar League to leave the Coalition and join with the Alliance of
Worlds. Gillian’s name comes up regularly.</p>
<p>Captain Kidd doesn’t travel much anymore but he occasionally can be
seen at the Baker Street Lounge on Dirty World Station. The spacers
there know how to reach out to him to connect with the League of
Hypatian Pirates to work Argo’s around the Coalition.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tamara
Tamara’s lost her position at the University of the Gifted Mind after
her work on The Big Dig. She is now privately funded and working on New
Senegal. Word has it that her backers support Realignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Emily Dickinson
Emily Dickinson has been seen on Three Ravens Space Station on the
southern frontier. As far as anyone knows, he’s sober and may pick up
a contract from time to time to keep him solvent. His political views
are unknown, but he goes back a long way with Gillian and has no love
for the Clouder.</p></li>
<li><p>Ronnie Camberwell and Captain Star Runner<br />
They have been working far afield. It is hard to say what their
loyalties are and whether they would be willing to come back to the
fringes of Coalition space. They would need a compelling reason.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Here are some points on how these last two would be pulled back:</em></p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Tamara is in trouble.</p></li>
<li><p>Ronnie will not stay if Star feels compelled to return.</p></li>
<li><p>There is nothing keeping them away at this point. The Clouder
threat to them personally has receded.</p></li>
<li><p>A mystery or a paid job would bring them back.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>The</em> Mystery</p>
<p>Tamara locates a jump gate near New Senegal. Its design does not
correspond to anything in any database she can find. Juliet can’t find
any reference to it either. Tamara sends a message to Star to see if
they can identify it. Star replies that it is a very old Clouder gate
but in their opinion, it’s in an area of space the Clouder never
traveled in. Star asks for some specific scans and reports some very
disturbing messages are on repeat at the gate. Josh is able to fully
decode them. The group is now sitting on some very explosive
information. If they want to go through the gate they will need all
their resources to do so. Tamara’s backers want this to happen but
there is a real danger their findings will rock the Coalition.</p>
<p>I have no idea what these messages are or what secrets lay beyond the
ancient gate. I don’t think the backer is benevalent. Perhaps this
person wants to take control of the Coalition for their own gain. Or
perhaps, and I like this idea better, the backer is a dreamy-eyed filanthropist.</p>
