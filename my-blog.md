# My Blog #

As I continue to work with my files, I have been thinking a lot about
this blog. I have entries that are over fifteen years old. Rereading
these is entertaining. I remind myself of things that happened that I
have forgotten. I suppose that is the point of writing: to make a
record that I can refer to at some time in the future. But here's the
thing: Is anyone going to scroll back that far to read these entries?

So I have decided to take these pieces and organize them by subject.
Right now I am working on my history with Elwood. He will have his own
section of material.

Eventually, the front page of my site will look very different. But
until my reorganization is well under way, I don't want to change
anything.

A long time ago, when folks were working on their web sites, they said
things like "Under Construction" and put a picture of a worker with a
sign to that effect. It's quaint now, but just know this is all under construction!
