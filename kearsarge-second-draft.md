# Kearsarge Second Draft #

I have been working through the first draft of a
[nanowrimo][nanowrimo] novel. I'm not even sure when I wrote it. Some
time ago I started breaking it apart into chapters in order to post
them.

The project ground to a halt because I ran into two problems:

1. I had introduced a spoken interface into a communications link. I
   later decided this was not a good idea as it distracted from my
   barebones storytelling of this particular book.
2. This conversation partner interfered with the progression of the
      plot and I couldn't quite work out how I got from one place to
      another. As a result, I was stuck.

	  Going back to it this week I discovered the logical problems did
      not seem so large or insurmountable. I just went ahead. This
      means the first five installments are more edited than the rest
      and another draft may be necessary along with spelling and
      gramatical issues. Nevertheless, I intend to post all of it so
      that it can be read and I can move on to other projects.
