# Our Walk was Crazy Today #

Our walk was crazy today. Nick was a smart alec for sure.

Unlike [last time](gps-uncertainties/),  we actually got into the
park. Strangely, Nick pushed against me to guide us into the loop going
in a counterclockwise direction Then he seemed unsettled, going off
the path, circling a bit and finally he just stopped. I couldn't
imagine anything ahead of us that would be dangerous. Nick touched my
hand with his nose. He was looking up at me, trying to communicate.

"Do you want to turn around?" I asked him.

Yes, he did. I expected him to walk out of the park, but no, he wanted
to make the loop in our usual clockwise direction. I guess there is a
right and wrong way to traverse our park.

We started back home and my Victor Reader Trek announced a landmark
for a crosswalk. Whoe! This is past our driveway. I turned us around
and suggested right. Nick turned in to a sidewalk, but it was going
uphill. Definitely not the sidewalk by our driveway. Was the GPS that
far off.

I turned around again. The GPS announced a driveway (It thinks it is a
street.) on my right. We are definitely too far. We turned around
again.

After that, we made it back. Nick was keeping it to himself that we
were across the driveway from our place, but I caught the white of a
sidewalk which is my clue to cross the driveway and get home.
